# Earthquakes Challenge Analysis Challenge 13

## Overview of Project

The premise of this project was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. In order to achieve this task, a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website was utilized to obtain geographical coordinates and magnitudes for the earthquakes. From there, Javascript and the D3.js library was used to extract the coordinates and magnitudes from the GeoJSON data. Lastly, the Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API call and to create an interactive earthquake data map.  Please see below for the analysis deliverables. 

- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data

- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
